# TeXdowN

TeXdowN is a lightweight alternative to LaTeX for writing short texts with math equations.
While TeXdowN is heavily influenced by Markdown it is **NOT** Markdown + MathJax. 
TeXDown is a work in progress.

## Why?

1. Markdown does not support math formula by itself.
2. Markdown is hard to parse.
3. Markdown is not well defined and even this 116 pages long (!!!) [Spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.28/) does not solve all the quirks of Markdown.

## The Language
